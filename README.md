Expending a bonus die will trigger a chat message. This messages are costumizable and feature keywords that will be automaticly replaced.

## Instalation

## Keywords

The complete list of keywords that are replaced is:
 - [$player] - will be replaced by the name of the player that has triggered the message
 - [$otherPlayer] - will be replaced by the target of an action (example in the default message of gifting a bonus die it is replaced by the recipient of the gift)
 - [$bonusDie] - will be replaced by the name of the bonus dice (configurable in the settings tab)
